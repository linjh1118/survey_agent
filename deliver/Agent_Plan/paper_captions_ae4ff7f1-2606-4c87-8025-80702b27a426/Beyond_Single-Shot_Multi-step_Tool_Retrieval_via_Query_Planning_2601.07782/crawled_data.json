  "title": "Beyond Single-Shot: Multi-step Tool Retrieval via Query Planning",
  "abstract": "LLM agents operating over massive, dynamic tool libraries rely on effective retrieval, yet standard single-shot dense retrievers struggle with complex requests.\nThese failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions.\nTo address these challenges, we proposeToolQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning.\nInstead of single-shot matching,ToolQPdecomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition.\nWe trainToolQPusing synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).\nExperiments demonstrate thatToolQPachieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.",

      "caption": "Overview of theToolQPframework. The Planner decomposes a complex user query (e.g., travel planning) into sequential sub-tasks. For each sub-task, it interactively generates queries, processes feedback from the dense retriever, and self-corrects if necessary, before aggregating the final set of relevant tools."
